# caspl_ass2

# To do:

- 'v' operation
- operation counter
- '^' operation - implement the check for y>200
- check free memory and verify with valgrind
- trim leading zeros - disabled for now becuse of bugs with the exponent. (if you use the two_power function alone with input '9', e.g. 2^9 it returns wrong result because of the trimming or something.

# Bugs:

- pushing 000 and pop_and_print - seg fault
- 1A * 0 = seg fault
