# caspl_ass2

# To do:

- 'v' operation
- operation counter
- '^' operation - implement the check for y>200
- handle memory leaks

# Bugs:

- 1A * 0 = seg fault

# Notes:

- I also wrote reverseList function, I merged with my function but it should be the same. So if you see errors with my version just let me know ahi.
