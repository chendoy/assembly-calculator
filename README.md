# caspl_ass2

# To do:

- handle memory leaks
- debug mode messages for all operations
- debug all operations thoroughly

# Bugs:

- '^' operation - check for y>200 not working. also need to be for 'v' operation (same check)
- leading zeros in mul_exp_oppo outputs

# Notes:

- I also wrote reverseList function, I merged with my function but it should be the same. So if you see errors with my version just let me know.
